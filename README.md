# Image Classification using CLIP

## 📝 Overview
This project utilizes OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) for zero-shot image classification. CLIP is a powerful multimodal model that can understand images and text in the same representation space, allowing it to classify images without task-specific training.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Load the CLIP Model** – The pre-trained CLIP model is used to extract embeddings from both images and text labels.
2. **Process the Input Image** – The image is transformed into a feature vector using CLIP’s vision encoder.
3. **Process the Text Labels** – Text descriptions of possible classes are encoded into vectors using CLIP’s text encoder.
4. **Compute Similarity** – The model calculates the similarity between the image features and text embeddings.
5. **Predict the Best Match** – The label with the highest similarity score is chosen as the classification result.

## 🖼 Example
If given an image of a cat, and text labels like:
✅ "a cat"
✅ "a dog"
✅ "a bird"

CLIP will identify the closest match and classify the image as "a cat" based on similarity scores.
