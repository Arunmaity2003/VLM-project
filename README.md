Image Classification using CLIP
📝 Overview
This project utilizes OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) for zero-shot image classification. CLIP is a powerful multimodal model that can understand images and text in the same representation space, allowing it to classify images without task-specific training.

🚀 How It Works
Load the CLIP Model – The pre-trained CLIP model is used to extract embeddings from both images and text labels.

Process the Input Image – The image is transformed into a feature vector using CLIP’s vision encoder.

Process the Text Labels – Text descriptions of possible classes are encoded into vectors using CLIP’s text encoder.

Compute Similarity – The model calculates the similarity between the image features and text embeddings.

Predict the Best Match – The label with the highest similarity score is chosen as the classification result.

🖼 Example
If given an image of a cat, and text labels like:
✅ "a cat"
✅ "a dog"
✅ "a bird"
CLIP will identify the closest match and classify the image as "a cat" based on similarity scores.
